## WELCOME ##
This project hosts SIMPL and SIMPL+ modules that can be used to control [Xbmc](http://xbmc.org/) from a Crestron system. The modules use the Xbmc [JSON-RPC api](http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=JSON-RPC_API).

The JSON-RPC API in Xbmc is under active development and new features can break existing functionality. For best results you should always use the most recent stable version of Xbmc (currently [12.3](http://xbmc.org/download/)). Although all functionality works on with 2-series processors I highly recommend using a 3-series processor due to the large amount of string processing that the module performs.

This project also contains sample programs and Vt-Pro-e projects that can be used to demonstrate and test the functionality of the Crestron modules.
